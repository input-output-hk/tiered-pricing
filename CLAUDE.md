## Project Overview

This is a simulation testbed for evaluating **tiered transaction fee mechanisms** for Cardano's linear-Leios protocol. It extends an existing Leios network simulator (`sim-rs/`) with tiered pricing, actor-based transaction generation, and welfare metrics.

The core research question: can a tiered pricing mechanism (Kiayias et al., "Tiered Mechanisms for Blockchain Transaction Fees", 2304.06014) improve welfare and inclusion fairness compared to flat-fee or EIP-1559-style mechanisms during congestion?

## Key Concepts

### The Tiered Pricing Mechanism

Based on Kiayias et al. (2304.06014). Block space is divided into tiers with increasing delays and decreasing prices:
- **Tier 0**: Immediate inclusion (1 block delay), highest price
- **Tier 1**: 2-block delay, lower price
- **Tier k**: 2^k block delay, lowest price

Prices update per-tier using EIP-1559 rules. Delays and tier count adjust less frequently. Users self-select tiers based on their urgency and willingness-to-pay.

### Value-Urgency Model

Transactions have value `v` and urgency parameter `u > 1`. Retained value after `d` blocks of delay:

```
retained_value = v * u^(-d)
```

High-urgency users (large `u`) lose value quickly with delay and prefer expensive fast tiers. Low-urgency users (small `u`) tolerate delay for cheaper tiers. This enables **price discrimination by urgency**.

### Actor System

Each actor config defines weighted value-urgency components. A transaction samples one component, getting correlated (value, urgency) from that component's distributions. The `urgency_component_index` field tracks which component was sampled, enabling per-urgency-class welfare metrics.

### Block Structure in Linear Leios

- **Ranking Blocks (RB)**: Produced with probability 0.05/slot (~1 per 20 slots). Max body 90,112 bytes.
- **Endorser Blocks (EB)**: Reference transactions, endorsed by votes.
- With `continuous_rb_eb` policy, tiers span both RB and EB capacity.
- `rb-generation-probability: 0.05` means **1 block ≈ 20 slots** — this is critical for interpreting delay units.

### Welfare Metrics

- **Retained value ratio**: `value_at_delay / initial_value` — primary optimization target
- **Net utility**: `retained_value - fee_paid`
- **Inclusion rate**: Fraction of generated txs that get included
- **Latency**: Slots from generation to on-chain inclusion
- Per-actor and per-urgency-class breakdowns reveal whether tiers achieve price discrimination

## Building and Running

```bash
cd sim-rs
cargo build --release

# Run a single experiment
scripts/run_sim_timestamped.sh \
  --experiment parameters/experiments/leios-sundaeswap-aggregate-capped-tier-pressure.yaml \
  --label my-run

# Compare two mechanisms (A/B test)
scripts/run_sim_timestamped.sh \
  --experiment parameters/experiments/leios-sundaeswap-aggregate-capped-tier-pressure.yaml \
  --compare-experiment parameters/experiments/leios-sundaeswap-baseline.yaml \
  --label sundaeswap-tiered-vs-baseline
```

Output goes to `output/eb-compare/<timestamp>-<label>/`. Key outputs:
- `metrics_comparison.txt` — welfare tables (per-actor, per-urgency-class)
- `time_series.csv` — slot-by-slot tier prices, fill rates, tx counts
- `diagnostics.log` — pricing mechanism state transitions

## Running Tests

```bash
cd sim-rs
cargo test
```

Tests are in `sim-core/src/sim/tests/` and inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules. They use deterministic seeded RNG for reproducibility.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Build after every change**: `cargo build` before moving on. Keep the feedback loop tight. If a build fails and you can't immediately see why, revert to the last working state, make a smaller change, and build again.
2. **Readability over cleverness**: This is a research codebase. Explicit, verbose code beats clever one-liners. Prefer explicit over implicit, verbose over terse, simple over clever.
3. **Determinism matters**: Always use seeded RNG (`StdRng::seed_from_u64`). Pass `&mut rng` explicitly rather than using thread-local randomness. Tests assert specific tx orderings.
4. **The mempool uses `IndexMap`**: O(1) lookups with insertion-order-preserving iteration. Use `shift_remove` (not `swap_remove`) to preserve order.
5. **Transaction has `urgency_component_index: Option<u16>`**: Must be set when constructing transactions (use `None` for legacy/test paths).
6. **Delay units are blocks, not slots**: `tier-delay-unit: blocks` in config. With `rb-generation-probability: 0.05`, 1 block ≈ 20 slots. A tier-0 delay of 1 block means ~20 slots minimum latency.

## Coding Standards

### Naming

- Types: `PascalCase` — `Transaction`, `TieredState`, `MetricsCollector`
- Functions: `snake_case` — `build_block`, `update_tier_prices`, `select_tier_for_transaction`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` — `DEFAULT_SLOT_DURATION_MS`, `MAX_TIERS`
- Booleans: prefix with `is_`, `has_`, `should_` — `is_mature`, `has_capacity`, `should_include`

### Error Handling

Use `Result` for operations that can fail, `Option` for values that may be absent. Avoid `.unwrap()` except in tests or when the invariant is obvious and documented:
```rust
// OK: invariant is clear
let first_tier = tiers.first().expect("tiers must be non-empty");

// Better: handle the case
let Some(first_tier) = tiers.first() else {
    return Err(SimulationError::NoTiersConfigured);
};
```

Use `saturating_add` / `saturating_sub` for counters and prices to prevent overflow.

### Numeric Pitfalls

Don't compare floats with `==`. Use approximate comparison where needed. Be explicit about whether slot/block ranges are inclusive or exclusive — document the convention in comments.

### Imports

Group in this order, separated by blank lines: (1) standard library, (2) external crates, (3) `crate::` internal, (4) `super`/`self`.

### When Stuck

If you encounter a design decision not covered here: choose the simpler option, document your choice with a comment, and make it easy to change later. For domain questions (what should happen when X meets Y, is this the right interpretation of the paper, which feature matters more) — stop and ask rather than guessing.

## Creating New Experiments

An experiment needs three things:

1. **Actor profile** (`parameters/actors/*.toml`): Defines actor groups with arrival rates, tx sizes, value-urgency components.
2. **Pricing config** (`parameters/pricing/*.toml`): Configures the fee mechanism (baseline, tiered, etc.).
3. **Experiment overlay** (`parameters/experiments/*.yaml`): References the above, sets `enforce-tier-delay`, `seed`, and protocol parameters.

Experiment YAML files layer on top of `config.default.yaml` via `-p` flags. Fields in the experiment override defaults.

## Parameter Layering

The CLI applies parameters in order: `config.default.yaml` → `linear.yaml` → experiment YAML. Later files override earlier ones. The `pricing.config-path` and `actors.config-path` fields point to TOML files loaded separately.
